Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp.
It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.
With Terraform, you can manage various cloud services and resources in a declarative way, meaning you specify the desired state of your infrastructure, and 
Terraform automatically handles the creation, modification, and management of the resources to achieve that state.
